## Introduction

Termux is a powerful Android application that provides:
1. A **terminal emulator** – a command-line interface where you type commands.
2. A **Linux environment** – where you can install packages, run code, and build projects.

With Termux, you can:
- Manage files and folders
- Install and use programming languages
- Connect to servers
- Run a local web server
- Use Git to manage projects
- Practice Linux skills directly on your phone

## The Shell Prompt

When you open Termux, you’ll see a shell prompt that looks like this:
```sh
$
```
This is where you type commands. For example:
```sh
echo "Hello Termux"
```
prints `Hello Termux` to the screen.

## File and Directory Management

Linux-style file and folder navigation works in Termux.

### Common Commands
- Show current location:
  ```sh
  pwd
  ```
- List files:
  ```sh
  ls
  ls -la   # include hidden files
  ```
- Create a new folder:
  ```sh
  mkdir projects
  ```
- Create a new file:
  ```sh
  touch notes.txt
  ```
- Enter a folder:
  ```sh
  cd projects
  ```
- Go back one level:
  ```sh
  cd ..
  ```
- Copy a file:
  ```sh
  cp notes.txt backup.txt
  ```
- Move/rename a file:
  ```sh
  mv notes.txt ideas.txt
  ```
- Delete a file or folder:
  ```sh
  rm ideas.txt
  rm -rf projects   # delete a folder recursively
  ```

> **Warning:** `rm` permanently deletes files. There is no recycle bin.

## Editing Files

Termux supports text editors like **nano** and **vim**.

- Open a file in nano:
  ```sh
  nano file.txt
  ```
- Save changes: `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`
- Exit nano: `Ctrl + X`

Nano is beginner-friendly; vim is more advanced.

## Package Management

Termux has its own package manager (`pkg`) to install and manage software.

- Update package list:
  ```sh
  pkg update
  ```
- Upgrade all installed packages:
  ```sh
  pkg upgrade
  ```
- Search for a package:
  ```sh
  pkg search python
  ```
- Install a package:
  ```sh
  pkg install python
  ```
- Uninstall a package:
  ```sh
  pkg uninstall python
  ```

## Networking Basics

- Test connectivity:
  ```sh
  ping google.com
  ```
- Download content:
  ```sh
  curl https://example.com
  wget https://example.com/file.zip
  ```
- Connect to a server via SSH:
  ```sh
  ssh user@server-ip
  ```

## Using Git

Git is widely used for version control. You can use it inside Termux.

- Install Git:
  ```sh
  pkg install git
  ```
- Clone a repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```
- Check status:
  ```sh
  git status
  ```
- Stage changes:
  ```sh
  git add filename
  ```
- Commit changes:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Your message"
  ```
- Push changes:
  ```sh
  git push origin main
  ```

## Running a Local Server

You can run a simple HTTP server using Python:
```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```
Now visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to view the contents of the folder.
